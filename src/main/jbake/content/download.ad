been created using GNU tar extensions. It must be untarred with a GNU compatible version of tar.

### Verifying Signatures
The sha256 and asc files are signature files and can be used to verify the integrity of the
downloaded distribution package.

Use the following commands to verify the integrity:

* gpg --print-md sha256 fileName.tar.gz
* gpg --verify fileName.tar.gz.asc

It might be necessary to import the https://www.apache.org/dist/opennlp/KEYS[KEYS file] to verify the integrity
of the asc files.

That can easily be done with:

* gpg --import KEYS

More information about release signing and verifying signatures can
be found https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing.html[here].
