 (gpg --list-sigs <your name>
     && gpg --armor --export <your name>) >> this file.
----
- In a local temp folder, svn checkout the OpenNLP artifacts and update the KEYS file
----
svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/opennlp/
svn commit -m"Added Key for <name>" KEYS
----
- Create a maven `settings.xml` to publish to `repository.apache.org`

## Step-by-Step

The following documents the steps which are necessary to make a
release of Apache OpenNLP.

- Release discussion and release planning on the mailing list
- Elect a release manager
- Prepare Jira for the release
- Crate an empty test plan for the release
- Make a release candidate
- Test the candidate according to the test plan and iterate until tests pass
- Call the release vote on opennlp-dev and on general incubator

## Releasing

The release candidate can be released after a successful release vote on
the opennlp-dev and incubator general list.

To do this go to the http://repository.apache.org[repository server], log in, go to the staging area and release the staging repository linked to this release
* Upload artifacts to the distribution server by following the steps below. All release artifacts need to be copied to `/www/www.apache.org/dist/opennlp` on `people.apache.org`
** In a local temp folder, svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/opennlp
** cd opennlp; mkdir opennlp-{xyz}; cd opennlp-{xyz}
** wget -e robots=off â€“no-check-certificate -np -r https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/opennlp/opennlp/{xyz}/
** mv repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/opennlp/opennlp/{xyz}/* .
