The Apache OpenNLP team is pleased to announce the release of Apache OpenNLP 3.0.0-M1.

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.

It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.

Apache OpenNLP 3.0.0-M1 binary and source distributions are available for download from our link:/download.html[download page].

The OpenNLP library is distributed by Maven Central as well. See the link:/maven-dependency.html[Maven dependency] page for more details.

== What's new in Apache OpenNLP 3.0.0-M1

The 3.x release line of Apache OpenNLP introduces no known breaking changes while significantly modularizing the project to improve library usage and future extensibility.
The core API remains stable and fully compatible with 2.x, so existing projects can continue using the opennlp-tools artifact without modifications.

Key Highlights and Recommendations:

* Modularization: The project is now organized into multiple modules:
* opennlp-api, opennlp-core, opennlp-cli, opennlp-extensions, ML modules (e.g., opennlp-ml-maxent, opennlp-ml-perceptron), and more.
* Users can include only the modules needed, reducing dependency footprint.
* Only opennlp-runtime is mandatory for basic functionality.
* CLI Stability: Existing command-line usage remains unchanged.

For further details, check the full list of link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311215&version=12355662[changes,role=external,window=_blank] via the project's issue tracker.

== Migrating from 2.x to 3.x

The 3.x release line of Apache OpenNLP introduces no known breaking changes but modularizes the project for better usage as a library and to support future extensibility. The core API remains stable and compatible with 2.x, but the project structure has been reorganized into multiple modules.

That means, that you can continue to use the previous opennlp-tools artifact as a dependency. However, we strongly recommend to switch to the new modular structure and import only the components you need, which will result in a smaller dependency footprint.

Only opennlp-runtime needs to be added as a dependency, and you can add additional modules (e.g. opennlp-ml-maxent, opennlp-models, etc.) as required by your project. For users of the traditional CLI toolkit, nothing changes with the 3.x release line. CLI usage remains stable
