The Apache OpenNLP project is developed by volunteers and is always looking for new contributors
to work on all parts of the project. Every contribution is welcome and needed to make it better.
A contribution can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to a new component. We especially welcome contributions from first-time users.

To get started, please first join the Apache OpenNLP mailing lists:

issues please post them to the JIRA pages and not to this list. This list is mainly for developers to keep track of changes and issues to be resolved; however, any changes should be posted to the JIRA pages and _not_ _directly_ to this mailing list.
