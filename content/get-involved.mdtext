Title: Get Involved

The Apache OpenNLP project is developed by volunteers and is always looking for new contributors
to work on all parts of the project. Every contribution is welcome and needed to make it better.
A contribution can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to a new component.

Before you start to contribute we suggest to join the user and development mailing lists.

A contribution is always done through [Apache OpenNLP JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENNLP). 
Please [create a JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=12311215&issuetype=4) 
which describes the change and attach a patch to it.
Every received patch will be reviewed and then either be committed or we give appropriate feedback
to change it.

Bigger contributions can eventually only be accepted when an
[ICLA](http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt), [CCLA](http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt)
or [software grant](http://www.apache.org/licenses/software-grant.txt) is on file.

Contributors who have a history of successful participation are invited to join
the project as a committer from the [PPMC](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html).
